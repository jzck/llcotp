PROBLEM
A system consists of one particle of mass M and n particles with equal masses m. Eliminate
the motion of the centre of mass and so reduce the problem to one involving n particles.
SOLUTION. Let R be the radius vector of the particle of mass M, and Ra (a = 1, 2, ..., n)
those of the particles of mass m. We put ra = Ra-R and take the origin to be at the centre
of mass: MR+mER = 0. Hence where =M + nm; Ra = R + ra.
Substitution in the Lagrangian L = gives
ra.
The potential energy depends only on the distances between the particles, and so can be
written as a function of the ra.
