PROBLEM
Find the law of transformation of the action S from one inertial frame to another.
SOLUTION. The Lagrangian is equal to the difference of the kinetic and potential energies,
and is evidently transformed in accordance with a formula analogous to (8.5):
Integrating this with respect to time, we obtain the required law of transformation of the
action:
S=S'tuV.R'+1uV2t,
where R' is the radius vector of the centre of mass in the frame K'.
