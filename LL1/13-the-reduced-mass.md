title: The reduced mass
---

A complete general solution can be obtained for an extremely important
problem, that of the motion of a system consisting of two interacting particles
(the two-body problem).
As a first step towards the solution of this problem, we shall show how it
can be considerably simplified by separating the motion of the system into
the motion of the centre of mass and that of the particles relative to the centre
of mass.
The potential energy of the interaction of two particles depends only on
the distance between them, i.e. on the magnitude of the difference in their
radius vectors. The Lagrangian of such a system is therefore
L =
(13.1)
Let r III r1-r2 - be the relative position vector, and let the origin be at the
centre of mass, i.e. M1r1+M2r2 = 0. These two equations give
= m2I/(m1+m2),
r2
-M1I/(m1+m2).
(13.2)
Substitution in (13.1) gives
L
(13.3)
where
m=mym
(13.4)
is called the reduced mass. The function (13.3) is formally identical with the
Lagrangian of a particle of mass m moving in an external field U(r) which is
symmetrical about a fixed origin.
Thus the problem of the motion of two interacting particles is equivalent
to that of the motion of one particle in a given external field U(r). From the
solution r = r(t) of this problem, the paths r1 = r1(t) and r2 = r2(t) of the
two particles separately, relative to their common centre of mass, are obtained
by means of formulae (13.2).
