PROBLEM 1. Determine the period of oscillations of a simple pendulum (a particle of mass
m suspended by a string of length l in a gravitational field) as a function of the amplitude of
the oscillations.
SOLUTION. The energy of the pendulum is E = 1ml2j2-mgl cos = -mgl cos to, where
o is the angle between the string and the vertical, and to the maximum value of . Calculating
the period as the time required to go from = 0 to = Do, multiplied by four, we find
-cos

The substitution sin $ = sin 10/sin 100 converts this to T = /(l/g)K(sin 100), where
1/75
-
is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. For sin 100 22 100 < 1 (small oscillations),
an expansion of the function K gives
T =

The first term corresponds to the familiar formula.
PROBLEM 2. Determine the period of oscillation, as a function of the energy, when a
particle of mass m moves in fields for which the potential energy is
(a) U = Alx
(b) U = Uo/cosh2ax, -U0 0, (c) U = Uotan2ax.
SOLUTION. (a):
T =
By the substitution yn = u the integral is reduced to a beta function, which can be expressed
in terms of gamma functions:
The dependence of T on E is in accordance with the law of mechanical similarity (10.2),
(10.3).
(b) T = (7/a)V(2m/E).
(c) T =(t/a)v[2m/(E+U0)]
