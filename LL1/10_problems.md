PROBLEM 1. Find the ratio of the times in the same path for particles having different
masses but the same potential energy.
SOLUTION. t'/t = (m'/m).
PROBLEM 2. Find the ratio of the times in the same path for particles having the same mass
but potential energies differing by a constant factor.
SOLUTION. I'/t
