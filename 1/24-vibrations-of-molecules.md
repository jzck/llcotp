SOLUTION. The equations of motion are x+ wo2x = ay, j + wo2y = ax. The substitution
(23.6) gives
Ax(wo2-w2) = aAy,
(1)
The characteristic equation is (wo2-w2)2= a2, whence w12 = wo2-a, w22 = wo2-+x. For
w = W1, the equations (1) give Ax = Ay, and for w = w2, Ax = -Ay. Hence x =
(Q1+Q2)/V2, y = (Q1-Q2)/V2, the coefficients 1/V2 resulting from the normalisation
of the normal co-ordinates as in equation (23.13).
For a < wo2 (weak coupling) we have W1 all wo-1x, W2 ill wotla. The variation of x
and y is in this case a superposition of two oscillations with almost equal frequencies, i.e.
beats of frequency W2-W1 = a (see $22). The amplitude of y is a minimum when that of x
is a maximum, and vice versa.
PROBLEM 2. Determine the small oscillations of a coplanar double pendulum (Fig. 1, $5).

1, becomes

dent oscillations of the two pendulums.
PROBLEM 3. Find the path of a particle in a central field U = 1kr2 (called a space oscillator).
SOLUTION. As in any central field, the path lies in a plane, which we take as the xy-plane.
The variation of each co-ordinate x,y is a simple oscillation with the same frequency
= v(k/m): x = a cos(wt+a), y=b cos(wt+), or x = a cos , y = b cos(+8)
= b cos 8 cos -b sin 8 sin , where = wt +a, 8 = B-a. Solving for cos o and sin o and
equating the sum of their squares to unity, we find the equation of the path:
This is an ellipse with its centre at the origin.t When 8 = 0 or IT, the path degenerates to a
segment of a straight line.
$24. Vibrations of molecules
If we have a system of interacting particles not in an external field, not all
of its degrees of freedom relate to oscillations. A typical example is that of
molecules. Besides motions in which the atoms oscillate about their positions
of equilibrium in the molecule, the whole molecule can execute translational
and rotational motions.
Three degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion, and in general
the same number to rotation, so that, of the 3n degrees of freedom of a mole-
cule containing n atoms, 3n-6 - correspond to vibration. An exception is formed
t The fact that the path in a field with potential energy U = 1kr2 is a closed curve has
already been mentioned in $14.

by molecules in which the atoms are collinear, for which there are only two
rotational degrees of freedom (since rotation about the line of atoms is of no
significance), and therefore 3n-5 vibrational degrees of freedom.
In solving a mechanical problem of molecular oscillations, it is convenient
to eliminate immediately the translational and rotational degrees of freedom.
The former can be removed by equating to zero the total momentum of the
molecule. Since this condition implies that the centre of mass of the molecule
is at rest, it can be expressed by saying that the three co-ordinates of the
centre of mass are constant. Putting ra = rao+Ua, where ra0 is the radius
vector of the equilibrium position of the ath atom, and Ua its deviation from
this position, we have the condition = constant = or
= 0.
(24.1)
To eliminate the rotation of the molecule, its total angular momentum
must be equated to zero. Since the angular momentum is not the total time
derivative of a function of the co-ordinates, the condition that it is zero can-
not in general be expressed by saying that some such function is zero. For
small oscillations, however, this can in fact be done. Putting again
ra = rao+ua and neglecting small quantities of the second order in the
displacements Ua, we can write the angular momentum of the molecule as
= .
The condition for this to be zero is therefore, in the same approximation,
0,
(24.2)
in which the origin may be chosen arbitrarily.
The normal vibrations of the molecule may be classified according to the
corresponding motion of the atoms on the basis of a consideration of the sym-
metry of the equilibrium positions of the atoms in the molecule. There is
a general method of doing so, based on the use of group theory, which we
discuss elsewhere. Here we shall consider only some elementary examples.
If all n atoms in a molecule lie in one plane, we can distinguish normal
vibrations in which the atoms remain in that plane from those where they
do not. The number of each kind is readily determined. Since, for motion
in a plane, there are 2n degrees of freedom, of which two are translational
and one rotational, the number of normal vibrations which leave the atoms
in the plane is 2n-3. The remaining (3n-6)-(2n-3) = n-3 vibrational
degrees of freedom correspond to vibrations in which the atoms move out
of the plane.
For a linear molecule we can distinguish longitudinal vibrations, which
maintain the linear form, from vibrations which bring the atoms out of line.
Since a motion of n particles in a line corresponds to n degrees of freedom,
of which one is translational, the number of vibrations which leave the atoms

in line is n - 1. Since the total number of vibrational degrees of freedom of a
linear molecule is 3n - 5, there are 2n-4 which bring the atoms out of line.
These 2n-4 vibrations, however, correspond to only n-2 different fre-
quencies, since each such vibration can occur in two mutually perpendicular
planes through the axis of the molecule. It is evident from symmetry that
each such pair of normal vibrations have equal frequencies.
PROBLEMS
PROBLEM 1. Determine the frequencies of vibrations of a symmetrical linear triatomic
molecule ABA (Fig. 28). It is assumed that the potential energy of the molecule depends
only on the distances AB and BA and the angle ABA.

SOLUTION. The longitudinal displacements X1, X2, X3 of the atoms are related, according
to (24.1), by MA(X1+x3) +mBX2 = 0. Using this, we eliminate X2 from the Lagrangian of the
longitudinal motion
L =
and use new co-ordinatesQa=x1tx,Qx1-x3.The result
where u = 2mA+mB is the mass of the molecule. Hence we see that Qa and Qs are normal
co-ordinates (not yet normalised). The co-ordinate Qa corresponds to a vibration anti-
symmetrical about the centre of the molecule (x1 = x3; Fig. 28a), with frequency
wa = (k1u/mAmB). The co-ordinate Q8 corresponds to a symmetrical vibration (x1 = -x3;
Fig. 28b), with frequency
The transverse displacements y1, y2, y3 of the atoms are, according to (24.1) and (24.2),
related by mA(y1+y2) +mBy2 = 0, y1 = y3 (a symmetrical bending of the molecule; Fig. 28c).
The potential energy of this vibration can be written as 1/22/282, where 8 is the deviation of the
angle ABA from the value IT, given in terms of the displacements by 8 = [(y1-yy)+(ys-y2)]/L.
Expressing y1,y2, y3 in terms of 8, we obtain the Lagrangian of the transverse motion:
L =
whence the frequency is = V(2k2u/mAmB).

The changes 8l1 and Sl2 in the distances AB and BA are obtained by taking the components
along these lines of the vectors U1-U2 and U3-U2:
8l1 = (x1-x2) sin cos a,
8l2 = -(x3-x2) sin at(y3-y2) cos a.
