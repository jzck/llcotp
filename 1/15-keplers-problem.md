title: 15 Kepler's problem
---

An important class of central fields is formed by those in which the potential energy is inversely proportional to $r$, and the force accordingly inversely proportional to $r^2$. They include the fields of Newtonian gravitational attraction and of Coulomb electrostatic interaction; the latter may be either attractive or repulsive.

Let us first consider an attractive field, where

```load
15.1
```

with a a positive constant. The "effective" potential energy

```load
15.2
```

is of the form shown in `fig10`. As $r\to 0$, $U_\text{eff}$ tends to $+\infty$, and as $r\to \infty$ it tends to zero from negative values ; for $r = M^2/m\alpha$ it has a minimum value

```load
15.3
```

```fig
10
```

It is seen at once from `fig10` that the motion is finite for $E <0$ and infinite for $E > 0$.

The shape of the path is obtained from the general formula `14.7`. Substituting there $U=-\alpha/r$ and effecting the elementary integration, we have

$$
\phi=\cos^{-1}\frac{(M/r)-(m\alpha/M)}{\sqrt{2mE+\frac{m^2\alpha^2}{M^2}}}
+\constant
$$

Taking the origin of such that the constant is zero, and putting

```load
15.4
```

we can write the equation of the path as

```load
15.5
```

This is the equation of a conic section with one focus at the origin; $2p$ is called the *latus rectum* of the orbit and $e$ the *eccentricity*. Our choice of the origin of is seen from `15.5` to be such that the point where $\phi = 0$ is the point nearest to the origin (called the *perihelion*).

In the equivalent problem of two particles interacting according to the law `15.1`, the orbit of each particl$e$ is a conic section, with one focus at the centre of mass of the two particles.

It is seen from `15.4` that, if $E\lt 0$, then the eccentricity $e \lt 1$, i.e. the orbit is an ellipse `fig11` and the motion is finite, in accordance with what has been said earlier in this section. According to the formulae of analytical geometry, the major and minor semi-axes of the ellipse are

```load
15.6
```

```fig
11
```

The least possible value of the energy is `15.3`, and then $e = 0$, i.e. the ellipse becomes a circle. It may be noted that the major axis of the ellipse depends only on the energy of the particle, and not on its angular momentum. The least and greatest distances from the centre of the field (the focus of the ellipse) are

```load
15.7
```

These expressions, with $a$ and $e$ given by `15.6` and `15.4`, can, of course, also be obtained directly as the roots of the equation $U_\text{eff}(r) = E$.

The period $T$ of revolution in an elliptical orbit is conveniently found by using the law of conservation of angular momentum in the form of the area integral `14.3`. Integrating this equation with respect to time from zero to $T$, we have $2mf = TM$, where $f$ is the area of the orbit. For an ellipse $f = \pi ab$, and by using the formulae `15.6` we find

```load
15.8
```

The proportionality between the square of the period and the cube of the linear dimension of the orbit has already been demonstrated in `10`. It may also be noted that the period depends only on the energy of the particle.

For $E \gt 0$ the motion is infinite. If $E > 0$, the eccentricity $e > 1$, i.e. the the path is a hyperbola with the origin as internal focus `fig12`. The distance of the perihelion from the focus is

```load
15.9
```

where $a = p/(e^2-1) = \alpha/2E$ is the "semi-axis" of the hyperbola.

```fig
12
```

If $E = 0$, the eccentricity $e = 1$, and the particle moves in a parabola with perihelion distance $r_\min = \mfrac{1}{2}p$. This case occurs if the particle starts from rest at infinity.

The co-ordinates of the particle as functions of time in the orbit may be found by means of the general formula `14.6`. They may be represented in a convenient parametric form as follows.

Let us first consider elliptical orbits. With $a$ and $e$ given by `15.6` and `15.4` we can write the integral `14.6` for the time as

\begin{align}
t
&=\sqrt{\frac{m}{2|E|}}\int\frac{r\dd{r}}{\sqrt{-r^2+(\alpha/|E|)r-(M^2/2m|E|)}} \\
&=\sqrt{\frac{ma}{\alpha}}\int\frac{r\dd{r}}{\sqrt{a^2e^2-(r-a)^2}}
\end{align}

The obvious substitution $r-a =-ae\cos\xi$ converts the integral to

$$
t=\sqrt{\frac{ma^3}{\alpha}}\int(1-e\cos\xi)\dd{\xi}=\sqrt{\frac{ma^3}{\alpha}}(\xi-e\sin\xi)+\constant
$$

If time is measured in such a way that the constant is zero, we have the
following parametric dependence of $r$ on $t$:

```load
15.10
```

the particle being at perihelion at $t = 0$. The Cartesian co-ordinates $x = r\cos\phi, y = r \sin\phi$ (the $x$ and $y$ axes being respectively parallel to the major and minor axes of the ellipse) can likewise be expressed in terms of the parameter $\xi$. From `15.5` and `15.10` we have

$$
ex=p-r=a(1-e^2)-a(1-e\cos\xi)=ae(\cos\xi-e)
$$

$y$ is equal to $\sqrt{r^2-x^2}$. Thus

```load
15.11
```

A complete passage round the ellipse corresponds to an increase of $\xi$ from $0$ to $2\pi$.

Entirely similar calculations for the hyperbolic orbits give

```load
15.12
```

where the parameter $\xi$ varies from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.
Let us now consider motion in a repulsive field, where

```load
15.13
```

Here the effective potential energy is

$$
U_\text{eff}=\frac{\alpha}{r}+\frac{M^2}{2mr^2}
$$

and decreases monotonically from $+\infty$ to zero as $r$ varies from zero to infinity. The energy of the particle must be positive, and the motion is always infinite. The calculations are exactly similar to those for the attractive field.  The path is a hyperbola (or, if $E = 0$, a parabola):

```load
15.14
```

where $p$ and $e$ are again given by `15.4`. The path passes the centre of the field in the manner shown in `fig13` The perihelion distance is

```load
15.15
```

The time dependence is given by the parametric equations

```load
15.16
```

To conclude this section, we shall show that there is an integral of the motion which exists only in fields $U = \alpha/r$ (with either sign of $\alpha$). It is easy to verify by direct calculation that the quantity

```load
15.17
```

is constant. For its total time derivative is $\dot{\v{v}}\times\v{M}+\alpha\v{v}/r-\alpha\v{r}(\v{v}\cdot\v{r})/r^3$ or,

$$
m\v{r}(\v{v}\cdot\dot{\v{v}})-m\v{v}(\v{r}\cdot\dot{\v{v}})+\alpha\v{v}/r-\alpha\v{r}(\v{r}\cdot\v{r})/r^3
$$

Putting $m\dot{\v{v}} = \alpha\v{r}/r^3$ from the equation of motion, we find that this expression vanishes.

```fig
13
```

The direction of the conserved vector `15.17` is along the major axis from the focus to the perihelion, and its magnitude is $\alpha e$. This is most simply seen by considering its value at perihelion.

It should be emphasised that the integral `15.17` of the motion, like $M$ and $E$, is a one-valued function of the state (position and velocity) of the particle.  We shall see in `50` that the existence of such a further one-valued integral is due to the *degeneracy* of the motion.

<!-- is the latus rectum of the unperturbed ellipse. In case (b) r2SU = y/r and, with 1/r/given by -->

<!-- The complete solution of the problem of the motion of a particle in a central -->

<!-- is sometimes called the area integral. -->
<!-- 32 -->
<!-- Integration of the Equations of Motion -->
<!-- ยง14 -->
<!-- The expression (14.4) shows that the radial part of the motion can be re- -->
<!-- garded as taking place in one dimension in a field where the "effective poten- -->
<!-- tial energy" is -->
<!-- (14.8) -->
<!-- The quantity M2/2mr2 is called the centrifugal energy. The values of r for which -->
<!-- U(r) -->
<!-- (14.9) -->
<!-- determine the limits of the motion as regards distance from the centre. -->
<!-- When equation (14.9) is satisfied, the radial velocity j is zero. This does not -->
<!-- mean that the particle comes to rest as in true one-dimensional motion, since -->
<!-- the angular velocity o is not zero. The value j = 0 indicates a turning point -->
<!-- of the path, where r(t) begins to decrease instead of increasing, or vice versa. -->
<!-- If the range in which r may vary is limited only by the condition r > rmin, -->
<!-- the motion is infinite: the particle comes from, and returns to, infinity. -->
<!-- If the range of r has two limits rmin and rmax, the motion is finite and the -->
<!-- path lies entirely within the annulus bounded by the circles r = rmax and -->
<!-- r = rmin- This does not mean, however, that the path must be a closed curve. -->
<!-- During the time in which r varies from rmax to rmin and back, the radius -->
<!-- vector turns through an angle Ao which, according to (14.7), is given by -->
<!-- Mdr/r2 -->
<!-- (14.10) -->
<!-- The condition for the path to be closed is that this angle should be a rational -->
<!-- fraction of 2n, i.e. that Ao = 2nm/n, where m and n are integers. In that case, -->
<!-- after n periods, the radius vector of the particle will have made m complete -->
<!-- revolutions and will occupy its original position, so that the path is closed. -->
<!-- Such cases are exceptional, however, and when the form of U(r) is arbitrary -->
<!-- the angle is not a rational fraction of 2nr. In general, therefore, the path -->
<!-- of a particle executing a finite motion is not closed. It passes through the -->
<!-- minimum and maximum distances an infinity of times, and after infinite time -->
<!-- it covers the entire annulus between the two bounding circles. The path -->
<!-- shown in Fig. 9 is an example. -->
<!-- There are only two types of central field in which all finite motions take -->
<!-- place in closed paths. They are those in which the potential energy of the -->
<!-- particle varies as 1/r or as r2. The former case is discussed in ยง15; the latter -->
<!-- is that of the space oscillator (see ยง23, Problem 3). -->
<!-- At a turning point the square root in (14.5), and therefore the integrands -->
<!-- in (14.6) and (14.7), change sign. If the angle is measured from the direc- -->
<!-- tion of the radius vector to the turning point, the parts of the path on each -->
<!-- side of that point differ only in the sign of for each value of r, i.e. the path -->
<!-- is symmetrical about the line = 0. Starting, say, from a point where = rmax -->
<!-- the particle traverses a segment of the path as far as a point with r rmin, -->
<!-- ยง14 -->
<!-- Motion in a central field -->
<!-- 33 -->
<!-- then follows a symmetrically placed segment to the next point where r = rmax, -->
<!-- and so on. Thus the entire path is obtained by repeating identical segments -->
<!-- forwards and backwards. This applies also to infinite paths, which consist of -->
<!-- two symmetrical branches extending from the turning point (r = rmin) to -->
<!-- infinity. -->
<!-- 'max -->
<!-- min -->
<!-- so -->
<!-- FIG. 9 -->
<!-- The presence of the centrifugal energy when M # 0, which becomes -->
<!-- infinite as 1/22 when r -> 0, generally renders it impossible for the particle to -->
<!-- reach the centre of the field, even if the field is an attractive one. A "fall" of -->
<!-- the particle to the centre is possible only if the potential energy tends suffi- -->
<!-- ciently rapidly to -00 as r 0. From the inequality -->
<!-- 1mr2 = E- U(r) - M2/2mr2 -->
<!-- or r2U(Y)+M2/2m < Er2, it follows that r can take values tending to zero -->
<!-- only if -->
<!-- (14.11) -->
<!-- i.e. U(r) must tend to - 8 either as - a/r2 with a > M2/2m, or proportionally -->
<!-- to - 1/rn with n > 2. -->

<!-- It should be emphasised that the integral (15.17) of the motion, like M and -->
<!-- E, is a one-valued function of the state (position and velocity) of the particle. -->
<!-- We shall see in ยง50 that the existence of such a further one-valued integral -->
<!-- is due to the degeneracy of the motion. -->
<!-- PROBLEMS -->
<!-- PROBLEM 1. Find the time dependence of the co-ordinates of a particle with energy E = 0 -->
<!-- moving in a parabola in a field U = -a/r. -->
<!-- SOLUTION. In the integral -->
<!-- we substitute r = M2(1+n2)/2ma = 1p(1+n2), obtaining the following parametric form of -->
<!-- the required dependence: -->
<!-- r=1p(1+n2), -->
<!-- t= -->
<!-- y=pn. -->
<!-- 40 -->
<!-- Integration of the Equations of Motion -->
<!-- ยง15 -->
<!-- The parameter n varies from - 00 to +00. -->
<!-- PROBLEM 2. Integrate the equations of motion for a particle in a central field -->
<!-- U = - a/r2 (a > 0). -->
<!-- SOLUTION. From formulae (14.6) and (14.7) we have, if and t are appropriately measured, -->
<!-- (a) for E > andM 0 and -->
<!-- (b) for E>0 0nd and M 2/2m a, -->
<!-- (c) for E <0 and Ms1 -->
<!-- In all three cases -->
<!-- In cases (b) and(c) the particle"falls"to the centre along a path which approaches the -->
<!-- origin as -->
<!-- 00. The fall from a given value of r takes place in a finite time, namely -->
<!-- PROBLEM 3. When a small correction SU(r) is added to the potential energy U = -a/r, -->
<!-- the paths of finite motion are no longer closed, and at each revolution the perihelion is dis- -->
<!-- placed through a small angle so. Find 80 when (a) SU = B/r2, (b) SU = y/r3. -->
<!-- SOLUTION. When r varies from rmin to rmax and back, the angle varies by an amount -->
<!-- (14.10), which we write as -->
<!-- in order to avoid the occurrence of spurious divergences. We put U= - -a/r+8U, and -->
<!-- expand the integrand in powers of SU; the zero-order term in the expansion gives 2nr, and -->
<!-- the first-order term gives the required change so: -->
<!-- (1) -->
<!-- where we have changed from the integration over r to one over , along the path of the "un- -->
<!-- perturbed" motion. -->
<!-- In case (a), the integration in (1) is trivial: 80 = -2nBm/M2 = -2nB/ap, where 2p (15.4) -->
<!-- is the latus rectum of the unperturbed ellipse. In case (b) r2SU = y/r and, with 1/r/given by -->
<!-- (15.5), we have 80 = -6naym2/M4 = -6ny/ap2. -->
