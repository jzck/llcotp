form the sum of their squares, which is unity. Since V10/2.20 = m2/m1, we have finally, using
(16.2),
(m2/m1) sin202+(m1/m2) sin201-2 sin O1 sin O2 cos(A1+6
PROBLEM 2. Find the angular distribution of the resulting particles in the L system.
SOLUTION. When vo > V, we substitute (16.6), with the plus sign of the radical, in (16.7),
obtaining
(0  .
When vo < V, both possible relations between Oo and 0 must be taken into account. Since,
when 0 increases, one value of Oo increases and the other decreases, the difference (not the
sum) of the expressions d cos Oo with the two signs of the radical in (16.6) must be taken.
The result is
(0    max).
PROBLEM 3. Determine the range of possible values of the angle 0 between the directions
of motion of the two resulting particles in the L system.
SOLUTION. The angle 0 = 01+02, where 01 and O2 are the angles defined by formula (16.5)
(see Problem 1), and it is simplest to calculate the tangent of 0. A consideration of the extrema
of the resulting expression gives the following ranges of 0, depending on the relative magni-
tudes of V, V10 and V20 (for definiteness, we assume V20 > V10): 0 0 77 if V10
< 0 < TT if V V V10, 0 < Oo if V > U20. The value of Oo is given by

ยง17. Elastic collisions
A collision between two particles is said to be elastic if it involves no change
in their internal state. Accordingly, when the law of conservation of energy
is applied to such a collision, the internal energy of the particles may be
neglected.
The collision is most simply described in a frame of reference in which the
centre of mass of the two particles is at rest (the C system). As in $16, we
distinguish by the suffix 0 the values of quantities in that system. The velo-
cities of the particles before the collision are related to their velocities V1 and
V2 in the laboratory system by V10 = M2V/(m1+m2), V20 = -m1V/(m1+m2),
where V = V1-V2; see (13.2).
Because of the law of conservation of momentum, the momenta of the two
particles remain equal and opposite after the collision, and are also unchanged
in magnitude, by the law of conservation of energy. Thus, in the C system
the collision simply rotates the velocities, which remain opposite in direction
and unchanged in magnitude. If we denote by no a unit vector in the direc-
tion of the velocity of the particle M1 after the collision, then the velocities
of the two particles after the collision (distinguished by primes) are
V10' m20120/(m1+m2), V20' = -mjono/(m1+m2).

In order to return to the L system, we must add to these expressions the
velocity V of the centre of mass. The velocities in the L system after the
collision are therefore
V1' =

V2' =
No further information about the collision can be obtained from the laws
of conservation of momentum and energy. The direction of the vector no
depends on the law of interaction of the particles and on their relative position
during the collision.
The results obtained above may be interpreted geometrically. Here it is
more convenient to use momenta instead of velocities. Multiplying equations
(17.2) by M1 and M2 respectively, we obtain
(17.3)
P2' muno+m2(p1+p2)/(m1+m2)
where m = m1m2/(m1+m2) is the reduced mass. We draw a circle of radius
mv and use the construction shown in Fig. 15. If the unit vector no is along
OC, the vectors AC and CB give the momenta P1' and P2' respectively.
When p1 and P2 are given, the radius of the circle and the points A and B
are fixed, but the point C may be anywhere on the circle.

Let us consider in more detail the case where one of the particles (m2, say) is
at rest before the collision. In that case the distance OB = m2p1/(m1+m2) = mv
is equal to the radius, i.e. B lies on the circle. The vector AB is equal to the
momentum P1 of the particle M1 before the collision. The point A lies inside
or outside the circle, according as M1 < M2 or M1 > M2. The corresponding

diagrams are shown in Figs. 16a, b. The angles 01 and O2 in these diagrams
are the angles between the directions of motion after the collision and the
direction of impact (i.e. of P1). The angle at the centre, denoted by X, which
gives the direction of no, is the angle through which the direction of motion
of m1 is turned in the C system. It is evident from the figure that 01 and O2

two particles after the collision, likewise expressed in terms of X:

The sum A1 + O2 is the angle between the directions of motion of the
particles after the collision. Evidently 01 + O2 > 1/1 if M1 < M2, and 01+O2 < 1st
if M1 > M2.
When the two particles are moving afterwards in the same or in opposite
directions (head-on collision), we have X=TT, i.e. the point C lies on the
diameter through A, and is on OA (Fig. 16b ; P1' and P2' in the same direc-
tion) or on OA produced (Fig. 16a; P1' and P2' in opposite directions).
In this case the velocities after the collision are

energy which can be acquired in the collision by a particle originally at rest
is therefore
(17.7)
where E1 = 1M1U12 is the initial energy of the incident particle.
If M1 < M2, the velocity of M1 after the collision can have any direction.
If M1 > M2, however, this particle can be deflected only through an angle
not exceeding Omax from its original direction; this maximum value of A1
corresponds to the position of C for which AC is a tangent to the circle
(Fig. 16b). Evidently
sin Omax = OC|OA = M2/M1.

PROBLEM
Express the velocity of each particle after a collision between a moving particle (m1) and
another at rest (m2) in terms of their directions of motion in the L system.
SOLUTION. From Fig. 16 we have P2' = 20B cos O2 or V2' = 2v(m/m2) cos O2. The momen-
tum P1' = AC is given by OC2 = AO2tp12-2AO.p cos or

for m1 > M2 the radical may have either sign, but for M2 > M1 it must be taken positive.
